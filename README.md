# PythonStart
Welcome to my Python Start File. 


This project is the start of my Python learning journey. I used online resources to create a rock-paper-scissors program called Jaken Po. 
While this is a simple program, I followed the instructions, and I will use it to explore different ways to solve the same problem in hopes of truly understanding Python and how to use certain programming fundamentals to achieve specific results. This is not my first time programming,g as I learned Java during College for my CS 1 & 2 courses. It has been a while since I actively practiced coding so I am approaching this as a beginner. Thank you for looking into my work, and I would love any feedback on how I can become a more well-rounded coder as I further my career in Information Technology. 

To run this, you must have Python 3.12 installed on your machine and a CLI.
