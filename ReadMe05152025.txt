While at work I was tasked with assisting in identifying volunteers who had a RecDesk profile. I was given an excel workbook that contained a list of volunteers containing their names, emails, and onboarding year.

I could have copied and pasted every email in this file into the system, searched for their name, and marked whether they had a profile, but then I remembered I could pull a list of emails from the system. I pulled that report, and now I needed to compare both lists and find the matches. This made my job easier and would have taken a day or more if I had not thought of this.

I used Python and the pandas library to accomplish this. Thank you for your time.

What it does: 
- Compares 2 CSV/Excel files containing email addresses.
- Identifies and lists matching emails in a new CSV file. (Data Handling/light automation)

What I learned: 
- How to read/write CSVs with pandas (Data Handling)
- How to handle Key Errors and clean column names. (Debugging)
- How to use Python to support workflows.
